A new way to co-edit by Frederic Peng
I found a new way to enable us to edit – in the  organization called "prismsus" (https://github.com/prismsus), one can create "teams" and  we can grant the team members writing access on certain repositories. I have created a team called "Stats2015" (https://github.com/orgs/prismsus/teams/stats2015). 
To invite other students to the team, we can go to the link above, and click on "Add a person" in the upper-right corner. After typing in their usernames (e.g. "Avrilla"), we can invite them to this team. I invited Avrilla for testing...
Currently, the Stats2015 team members will only have the permission to "rprog" repository, which makes sense.

To update the files to github, we need to "pull" the rprog repository to our computers, update it, and "push" it back. Following are the git codes.

*******************************************************
# First, go to the repository that will contain all "rprog" files (recommendation: name it rprog too :D)
cd .../rprog # (or some name else)
git init # if we don't have git there yet

# Pull the repository from github to the computer
git pull https://github.com/prismsus/rprog master 
# this doesn't need passwords; everyone can pull it

# update our own files to the folder...

# add & commit the changes
git add --all
git commit -m "blabla"

# push it to github
git push https://github.com/prismsus/rprog master
# this requires passwords; only the team members can push it to github
